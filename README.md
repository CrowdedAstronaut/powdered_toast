## Project Description <a name="about"></a>

Powdered Toast is a deployed, mobile first, responsive site about powdered toast. The site allows users to learn more about powdered toast, it's history, ways to eat it, good food pairings, as well as a form to sign up for the newsletter and a link to the newsletter. This project was an exercise in:

- Mobile First Methodology
- Pixel Perfect Design Implementation
- SCSS
- Semantic naming conventions
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

## Learning Experience <a name="leaarning"></a>

### This challenge tested all of my layout skills, some of the things that stood out to me were:
1) mobile first - I always try to code things stacked vertically & then use some sort of responsive media query to unstack for desktop.
2) width/height vs max-width & max height. If a design says the max-width for a container is 1440px desktop & 375px mobile - what's the best root structure to implement those rules?
3) relative positioning, absolute positioning, & z-index. Figuring out how to stack the logo and the hamburger menu on top of the hero image was a gun challenge.
4) pixel perfect design - Coding something from a Figma design file is one of my favorite challenges to tackle. There were a lot of details to pay attention to here, I'm curious how close I got.
5) responsive nav, hamburger menu, no JavaScript - I'm proud of this work.
6) css variables/mixins - this challenge had lots of different line heights & font sizes declared as part of the layout. I created a lot of SASS variables, but I think there is a more concise way. I think it's possible to store 2 properties (font-size & line height) in 1 rule.
7) sass - I built this project using vanilla CSS and I used sass for seperation of concerns.
8) changing the fill color of svgs using the CSS function filter(). That was a new discovery.

## Future Directions <a name="future"></a>
I'd like to get the desktop version a little closer to spec. The nav needs to be centered, and all of the font-size/line height values change on desktop. Those changes are just a media query away, but I did not get to address them by the time of this commit. I would also like to implement the image carousel functionality with either CSS or JS.
